# Archived Source Code

Several older (and maybe outdated) small libraries and code snippets that had been originally published on my [personal website](https://www.ulrichmierendorff.com).

## [`kyoto_tycoon`](kyoto_tycoon/kyoto_tycoon_python-0.1.0): Kyoto Tycoon Binary protocol

Code to access the [Kyoto Tycoon](https://dbmx.net/kyototycoon/) database system with Python and PHP usings its efficient binary protocol. The implementation follows the original documentation of the protocol. This library was created to use Kyoto Tycoon as a database caching layer for my web application [Album Reminder](https://www.albumreminder.com).

## [`antialiased_arcs`](antialiased_arcs): Rendering Antialiased Filled Arcs, Ellipses and Circles with PHP and GD

A simple yet effective method to render filled arcs with PHP. People used that to create pie diagrams and other dynamic visual effects. It might still be in use on certain websites.
